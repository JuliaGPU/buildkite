# JuliaGPU Buildkite

This repository contains resources related to the JuliaGPU Buildkite CI infrastructure:

- a custom Ubuntu-based image that can be based off of another image (e.g.
  CUDA's images);
- support for encrypted environment variables in the pipeline, and an
  environment hook to decode them;
- Docker Compose templates and systemd service files to tie everything together,
  and give each job a safe and reproducible execution environment.

Many of these features come from the fact that the JuliaGPU CI is intended to be
run on a variety of repositories (and external PRs to those repositories),
whereas Buildkite is typically used within the (trusted) boundaries of a single
organization.

This README documents how to use the JuliaGPU Buildkite CI. For details on the available
agents, or how to add one, see the [agents README](agents/README.md). **Note that this
Buildkite set-up is fairly new, and the set-up may still change. Keep an eye on this README
if anything breaks.**


## Adding a repository

If your Julia package can use a GPU, you may use the JuliaGPU CI infrastructure to run tests
on a system with a GPU. This is **not a general-purpose CI service**, and only intended to
run GPU-related tests of Julia packages. For all other testing, use public infrastructure
(Travis, Github Actions, etc).

Before everything else, the [the Buildkite
app](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/Iv1.112bf4be3e5ecdeb) needs to be
available for the GitHub organization that hosts your repository. If the organization is not
listed, a user with administrative privileges on both the JuliaLang BuildKite and the GitHub
organization in question should [set that
up](https://buildkite.com/organizations/julialang/repository-providers/new) and make sure
the organization is then listed as a [repository
provider](https://buildkite.com/organizations/julialang/repository-providers). You should
coordinate this on the #gpu channel of the JuliaLang slack, and ping BuildKite admins
(@maleadt, @vchuravy, @DilumAluthge, ...).

Next, a BuildKite admin should set-up a pipeline for your repository:

1. [Create a new pipeline](https://buildkite.com/organizations/julialang/pipelines/new),
   using the package's name.

   a. Under `Git Repository`, select the GitHub organization (if it isn't listed, the
   BuildKite app isn't properly set up) and the repository from the drop-down. Make sure
   check-out uses HTTPS.

   b. Check `Auto-create webhooks`.

   c. Grant permission to the JuliaGPU team.

2. Use the following steps, and click `Save and Close`:

   ```yaml
   steps:
     - label: ":buildkite: Pipeline upload"
       command: buildkite-agent pipeline upload
       branches: "!gh-pages"
       agents:
         queue: "juliagpu"
   ```

3. Navigate to the Pipeline Settings.

   a. Under general settings, make the pipeline public by clicking the big green button.

   b. Under GitHub settings, check the box to `Build pull requests from
   third-party forked repositories` and to `Build tags`.

Finally, you should create `.buildkite/pipeline.yml` in your repository with the steps to
perform GPU CI. Start from the following template:

```yaml
env:
  SECRET_CODECOV_TOKEN: "..."

steps:
  - label: "Julia v1"
    plugins:
      - JuliaCI/julia#v1:
          version: "1"
      - JuliaCI/julia-test#v1: ~
      - JuliaCI/julia-coverage#v1:
          codecov: true
    agents:
      queue: "juliagpu"
      cuda: "*"
    if: build.message !~ /\[skip tests\]/
    timeout_in_minutes: 60
```

If you want to perform several tests, or introduce test phases, you may want to add
additional steps. Note that each step is run in a fresh container (as opposed to how
Buildkite normally works), so you need to repeat the set-up that provides Julia (here done
by the `julia` plugin) and/or instantiates your project (done by the `julia-test` plugin).
If you need to send resources across steps, use
[artifacts](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/artifacts).

For coverage submission to Codecov to work, you need to encrypt your `CODECOV_TOKEN` and
specify it as a global `SECRET_CODECOV_TOKEN` (see below).



## Using secrets

During start-up, agents will scan for `SECRET_` environment variables and decrypt their
contents for use in the rest of the pipeline. If you want to use this mechanism to provide,
say, a secret `CODECOV_TOKEN`, run the `encrypt` script in this repository and follow its
prompts:


```
$ ./tools/encrypt
Variable name: CODECOV_TOKEN
Secret value:

Use the following snippet in your pipeline.yml:

env:
  SECRET_CODECOV_TOKEN: "kaIXEN51HinaQ4JGclQcIgxeMMtXDb5uvnP3E2eKrH4Eruf2pKd5QwUGcIVL8+rcWeo5FWj883rNxRQEH3YeCWs6/i7vzs+ORvG51QeCNYQgNqFzPsWRcq5qJYc+JPFbisS7q9nghqWTwr52cnjarD4Xx3ceGorMyS5NvFpCNxMgqHNyGkLvipxcTTJfKZK61bpnbntoIjiIO1XSZKjcxnXFGFnolV9BHCr5v8f7F42n2tUH7X3nDHmTBr1AbO2lFAU9ra/KezHcIf0wg2HcV8LZD0+mj8q/SBPjQZSH7cxwx4Q2eTjT4Sw7xnrBGuySVm8ZPCAV7nRNEHo+VqR+GQ=="
```

If your version of OpenSSL is too old, the `./tools/encrypt` script may fail.
In that case, you can run it inside Docker:
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/root ubuntu bash -c 'apt update && apt install -y openssl && /root/tools/encrypt'
```
